# MeWe Fluid Auto Multi-Column Layout
A Userstyle for MeWe.com to hide the side bars and make posts fluidly use multiple columns instead of just one column and use the full width of your window. Use with the Stylus extension in your browser.

This style is hosted at userstyles.org , but that site has long been rendered useless with its lack of development and maintenance. It's excessively slow, times out all the time, and it's been like that for years. This will be it's official home for whenever that site just drops dead.

# Installation
